<h1>About me</h1>

  <img src="/images/icon.png" width="350">

 <p>My name is Jaden Edward Combs-North. I am currently living in El Reno, Oklahoma. I am the oldest of my family, and my favorite hobbies are playing video games, practicing my writing skills, listeing to music, and traveling with my
  family. I am currently attending Canadian Valley Technology Center as an adult student to learn about my favorite subject, Computer Programming. This is so I can learn computer languages like Javascript and Pyhton. My ambition in life is to become a professional web developer and I hope that one of my inventions in the future will help contribute
  to our society.</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>I am passionate about my work because it's what I love to do. I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best and achieve my goals. In my last project, it taught me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that will help me do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photo Editing Software to improve the quality of photos and edit them properly so they could look more intriguing to the viewer. I soon became an important figure to my colleagues when they needed help with editing pictures.</p>
